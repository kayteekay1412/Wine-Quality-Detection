# Wine Quality Detection

## Overview
This repository contains the code and dataset for a project on wine quality detection using machine learning techniques. The project is implemented in Jupyter Notebook (`Wine_Quality.ipynb`) and utilizes the dataset `winequality-red.csv`.

## Project Structure
- `Wine_Quality.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook file containing the main project code.
- `winequality-red.csv`: Dataset used for analysis and modeling.

## Description
In this project, I explored the task of predicting wine quality based on its physicochemical properties. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, includes various features such as acidity levels, residual sugar, pH, alcohol content, and more. Using Python programming and machine learning libraries like scikit-learn, I performed the following tasks:
- Data preprocessing: Cleaning, transforming, and scaling the dataset to prepare it for modeling.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing relationships between variables and understanding their distributions.
- Model building: Implementing several machine learning algorithms to predict wine quality.
- Model evaluation: Assessing model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Through this project, I gained practical experience in feature engineering, model selection, and performance evaluation in the context of data science and machine learning.

## Usage
To run the notebook locally:
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kayteekay1412/Wine-Quality-Detection.git
   ```
2. Open `Wine_Quality.ipynb` using Jupyter Notebook.
3. Run the cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis and results.
